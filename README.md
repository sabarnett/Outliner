# Outliner

For many years, I have managed projects, both big and small, using a simple
outliner application. Sadly, this was on Windows and my conversion to Mac came with 
a small issue in that I didn't have an outliner. In the end, I went with My-Life-Organized which
gave me a PC app and an iOS app. The iOS app ran on the Mac, so I hd an interim solution.

This has worked 'ok' for me, but I had a desire for a much simpler system and a system that ran
natively on the Mac. So, I set about my first substantial Mac application; Outliner. 

The only requirement was that I allow me to manage outlines in the same way I used to on 
the PC. File format compatibility with the PC was a nice to have. The result is the Outliner App:
