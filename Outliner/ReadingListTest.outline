Or rather, she hadn’t survived much past the initial impact. For a while she had clung to her life; screaming and crying out in pain whilst the first people on the scene tried to free her. Her son was in the back of the car, hanging upside down by the belt keeping him strapped to his seat. He looked dead, hanging there and motionless. Bill, later, would find himself wishing his little boy had died. If he just never opened his little eyes again, everything would be easier. For the boy that was.

On the one hand I might be alone, just as I had first believed, but on the other hand - whatever is waiting down there could just be silently biding its time, waiting for me to get closer. Then, it would strike. The hairs on the back of my neck stood to attention and so too did the little wispy hairs on my arm. I was sure I wasn’t alone.&#xA;&#xA;‘Anyone there?’ I called out.

Always carefully planned out by world-famous Prepper and Survivalist Wolf Henderson, season ten promises to be different This time none of the contestants are survivalists. They’ve all been picked to fail.&#xA;&#xA;But when an EMP hits, the cast scatters and Wolf is left to care for a husband and wife team, a quietly scrappy chick, and a bumbling scientist. At the spur of the moment, Wolf offers them safety at his island bug-out location and takes off with his ragtag team to move through the wild and dangerous swampland of Florida.&#xA;&#xA;The loner of the group, Regan, isn’t sure what to do. She can’t survive on her own, but she also doesn’t work well in a group. She believes she has a better shot in one of the major cities on the coast than in the swamp, so she joins the team with every intent of striking out on her own once the opportunity arises. But with the world around them growing more dangerous every day, she has to figure out whether she’s better off with the group or alone in the post-EMP world.&#xA;&#xA;And whether Regan or Wolf realize it, the dangerous journey through swampland will soon become a literal fight for survival once they reach the chaos of ‘civilized’ South Florida.&#xA;&#xA;**Surviving the Refuge**&#xA;They thought their journey would be over when they reached the island refuge, but life isn’t as simple as what they’d hoped. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;At first glance, Wolf’s home is a prepper’s dream, but there’s a whole new learning curve that comes with living on the island. Regan is frustrated to learn that Wolf’s twelve-year-old daughter outmaneuvers her constantly, and more seriously than that, Regan begins to feel like every move she makes is the wrong one—all except with Wolf, that is. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Even as the group begins to acclimate to the island, Wolf has to stay strong for his team and his daughter. Making it “home” wasn’t the relief he thought it would be. Instead, he finds a whole new range of skills he has to teach the group, and it all has to happen in the face of failing equipment and a quickly approaching storm season. Everywhere he turns, he finds something else going unexpectedly wrong.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Struggling to keep up with the demands of life on an island and as part of a group, Regan finds herself in a rapidly disintegrating situation that causes her to question everything: her survival skills, the integrity of the group, and even the promise of safety they’ve worked so hard to secure. It’s enough to have her considering striking out on her own—even if it means threatening the safety of the team. But when the true threat is revealed, it will burn down everything the team knows—the good and the bad.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;**Surviving the Elements&#xA;**&#xA;Wolf has watched his entire world go up in flames. Now, Regan must help him pick up the pieces if they hope to survive…&#xA;&#xA;After the total disintegration of the island, Regan, Wolf, and the rest of the group decide to return to the one place they’ve called home—the swamp. However, returning isn’t as easy as it seems. The journey across Florida presents a whole new range of horrors as society breaks down, made all the worse when one of their own gets seriously injured. Plus, the team must face the trek with two new members whom some believe don’t belong with them at all.&#xA;&#xA;With danger and supply shortages at every step, questions are raised whether or not they’re making the best choice in returning. And while Regan believes she’s learned her lesson—groups are the way to go—it’s terrifying to make the final leap and fight not just survive... but to live.&#xA;' created='Sat, 4 Feb 2023 22:27:14 +0000'></outline>

Another reason is the Hugo Packet, which is a package of many of the nominated works to give one place where a voter can catch up on many of the works before they place their final ballots. I pay for a Supporting membership every year for the packet, which makes a great recommended reading list. If that sounds like a great deal, it is, and you might want to consider supporting WSFS and the Hugo Awards with that Supporting membership and by voting.&#xA;' created='Sat, 4 Feb 2023 22:27:14 +0000'></outline>

The thin air made periods of exertion impossible and anything other than a casual walk was becoming increasingly difficult. Once recovered, she again checked she was not being followed before making her way to the edge of the valley and around the ravine.&#xA;&#xA;The cave was close by and shielded, from the top, by densely packed shrubs. She pushed against the branches then, as the dried withered leaves crumbled in her hand, slid between wood and rock until she slipped into the cool dark interior of the cliff.&#xA;&#xA;Every day she feared the worst and every day she was relieved to find they still had not been discovered. She dropped to her knees and checked the contents of the first.&#xA;&#xA;This small cavern, cut out of the rock thousands of years ago by wind and rain, provided the perfect environment for her water-gathering devices. The cave, slightly cooler than the outside air, accumulated moisture in the depths of night, which was then collected in small jugs beneath plastic sheets. A number of such devices scattered around the floor provided just enough water for the two of them to survive.&#xA;&#xA;She sat back and rested a moment before amassing her yield.&#xA;&#xA;The sharp corner of a folded sheet of paper, nestled inside her clothing like a baby in a pouch, pressed uncomfortably against a rib. She looked down and slipped her hand inside the fabric to retrieve the document.&#xA;&#xA;It had started to come apart some time ago and was now held together with a great deal of tape. It was yellow and frayed, and she only looked at it occasionally as a rare treat. Carefully, she opened out the sheet, as though it were the most pure gold, until it was spread across her lap. This was more valuable than gold, though, especially now, and she would kill to protect it, as it was all that remained of a decimated life.&#xA;&#xA;Distant Suns - The Journey Home is the sequel to Distant Suns.&#xA;' _status='checked' Completion='Wed, 8 Nov 2023 10:16:20 +0000' created='Sat, 4 Feb 2023 22:27:14 +0000'></outline>

And the life of his best friend and mentor, Harry.&#xA;&#xA;Damien can trust no one, that much is clear, especially now that a list of crimes has appeared on the wall: CHEAT, MURDERER, ABUSER, WHORE, TRAITOR, TRICKSTER, PEDDLER, PREDATOR, CRUSADER, THIEF.&#xA;&#xA;What does the list mean, and who is the Landlord? Only time will tell, but Damien must make sure that he ends up the winner, because all of the losers are dead. Let the games begin. Are you ready?&#xA;&#xA;The Housemates is the most twisted book yet from Horror Mastermind, Iain Rob Wright. Fans of the Saw movie franchise and lovers (or haters) of reality TV will delight in the tortures that await them. An unforgettable tale of squeamish horror.

But there is no sign of civilization. And no answers to why they are there. **&#xA;&#xA;Charles and his companions simply wake up in log cabins in the middle of a vast wilderness. There are no roads, no planes in the sky, and not even a speck of trash in the streams. To survive, they must relearn what their generation has long forgotten—how to live with nothing but nature for support.&#xA;&#xA;And then there are those strange phenomena hovering overhead. What are they doing there and what is their connection to their predicament? Charles is determined to find out, and if whoever is responsible for this dim shadow of Eden has harmed his family, there will be hell to pay.&#xA;' _status='checked' created='Sat, 4 Feb 2023 22:27:14 +0000' Completion='Wed, 8 Nov 2023 10:16:20 +0000'></outline>

A number so large it’s calculated to disappear into the end of any list of Foundation facilities, no matter how many are in operation. Half the time it’s abbreviated in the logs so you’d just miss it reading through: Site-x398x, Site-239xx, Site-xx981. I’ve seen it referenced all three ways in the same file, disguising it as three separate facilities to conceal the supplies going there and the data being returned.&#xA;&#xA;What’s it for? I don’t know. Research, obviously. The kind of research you don’t tell the Ethics Committee about. It has to have the approval of the 05 Council or else it wouldn’t be allowed to exist, but that is the extent of what I know. And it doesn’t matter anymore. A top secret research facility with a discretionary budget larger than some countries, and when Task Force Catulus broke through the door they found absolute destruction. The site staff was missing, presumed kidnapped (or possibly eaten). Most of the equipment was gone too, right down to the cutlery in the mess hall. Whatever remained had been torn to pieces and scattered across the facility. The surviving computer hard drives were corrupted or fried, with barely a handful of surviving data that the techs managed to retrieve after days of work. There wasn’t much hard evidence left either, but my team examined whatever they could find. They filtered out anything clearly unrelated to the disaster, and presented me with fourteen mostly intact items from the labs and offices. It’s the best we could do.&#xA;&#xA;Now I have to piece it all together.&#xA;&#xA;Thank God for coffee.&#xA;' _status='checked' Completion='Wed, 8 Nov 2023 10:16:20 +0000' created='Wed, 12 Jul 2023 10:58:54 +0000'></outline>

The few people milling about outside getting ready for their daily business had said they couldn’t make out what the cries were about when they were interviewed. Not initially. Not until Anne, a pretty woman in her early thirties with shoulder length blonde hair, spilled out onto the street wearing nothing more than her dressing gown and slippers anxiously calling out for her five year old son, Thomas, to come out from wherever he was hiding. Eye witnesses reported Anne was closely followed by her husband Bill - a professional, clean-shaven man in his late thirties with dark, short hair - half dressed for work in his suit trousers and unbuttoned white shirt, and that he too looked just as frantic as the mother did.&#xA;&#xA;The year was 2003; the year Thomas disappeared from his home without a trace.&#xA;' _status='checked' Completion='Thu, 16 Nov 2023 19:23:00 +0000' created='Mon, 9 Oct 2023 13:07:59 +0000'></outline>
